# Disclaimer – Agentforce Agent Script Conversion

This tool interprets your existing Agentforce agent metadata configuration and generates a version that is compatible with the new Agentforce agent script format.

The conversion process is **automated** and based on **best-effort interpretation** of the current agent configuration. As a result, the generated Agentforce agent script must be **thoroughly reviewed, validated, and tested** before use in any environment.

## Your Responsibilities

In particular, you are responsible for reviewing and testing:

- **Agent topics** and their alignment with the new planner functionality
- **Agent actions** and associated parameters
- **Execution logic**, decision flows, and planner behavior
- **Any dependencies**, integrations, or custom logic impacted by the conversion

## Important Notice

This tool **does not guarantee functional equivalence** between the original agent and the generated script. Behavioral differences may occur due to changes in architecture, planner execution, or supported capabilities in the new Agentforce agent framework.

## By Proceeding, You Acknowledge and Accept That:

- You are **solely responsible** for validating the generated output
- You will perform **detailed functional and regression testing**
- You understand that the converted script is provided **"as is"**, without warranties of correctness, completeness, or fitness for a particular purpose
